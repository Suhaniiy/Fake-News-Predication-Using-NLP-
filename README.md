This project focuses on building an NLP-based machine learning model that detects whether a news article is Fake or Real based on its textual content. With the rapid spread of misinformation across digital platforms, automated fake news detection has become essential for ensuring reliability and trust in online information.

The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean, transform, and understand news text, followed by classification models that predict the authenticity of the content.
